          </p>
            Debate starts at the stated time and may be modified by moderator due to reasons which may include unavailability of debaters. Debaters must have sought permission. Comments and opinions are open to all participating moderators and debaters when debate starts, closed to all others.
            Voting is enabled after debate ends and rebuttal is ongoing. Only registered followers can vote and votes cannot be retrieved or changed after being cast. Registered followers can then give opinions, rebuttals or seek clarification on points raised.
            Moderators close the debate when debate ends or at a preset time set.

          Judges access debaters as a group and on individual basis. Debaters are accessed on the following criteria;
          <ul>
            <li>Grammar/Vocabulary</li>
            <li>Articulation/Enunciation</li>
            <li>Brevity</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
          Each of these are scored on a scale of 10 for each debater and adds up to the group’s average score of 30.
          N.B: Votes make up 70% (and may be increased for use case) of total points and may be the only judging criteria in open debates or debates excluding judges’ observation.
           Each judge gives his verdict (in his admin panel), collated and added to votes, to get the winner.
